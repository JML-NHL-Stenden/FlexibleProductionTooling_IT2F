# Product Module - Changes Summary

## Overview

The Product Module has been completely refactored to provide a clean, intuitive interface for product registration with QR code generation and assembly instruction management.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Models** (`models/`)

#### `product.py`

- Enhanced QR code generation with better error handling
- Added computed field for QR filename
- Added instruction count field
- Improved docstrings and code organization
- Better QR code configuration (box size, error correction)

#### `instruction.py`

- Renamed fields for better clarity (e.g., "Step #" instead of "Sequence")
- Made title required
- Added helpful field descriptions

#### `page.py`

- No changes needed - already properly configured

### 2. **Views** (`views/product_assemble_views.xml`)

Complete rewrite with the following improvements:

#### Instruction Views

- **Tree View**: Editable inline list with drag-and-drop ordering
- **Form View**: Clean form for detailed instruction editing with image support

#### Product Views

- **Tree View**: Shows all products with QR code thumbnails and instruction counts
- **Form View**: Beautiful product detail page with:
  - Large product image display
  - QR code preview and download
  - Assembly instructions tab with inline editing
  - Drag-and-drop ordering

#### Main Page View

Two clean tabs:

1. **Register Product**: Quick inline registration of products
2. **Products List**: View all products with QR codes, click to view/edit instructions

### 3. **Security** (`security/ir.model.access.csv`)

- Updated permissions to allow users to delete products and instructions
- Maintained appropriate read/write permissions for the page model

### 4. **Manifest** (`__manifest__.py`)

- Updated summary and description to reflect new features
- Cleaned up comments
- Better structured data file declarations

### 5. **Dependencies**

#### New Files:

- `requirements.txt`: Added `qrcode[pil]>=7.0` for QR code generation

#### Updated Files:

- `Dockerfile`: Now installs Python dependencies from requirements.txt

### 6. **Documentation**

#### New Files:

- `odoo/addons/product_module/README.md`: Comprehensive module documentation
- `CHANGES.md`: This file - summary of changes

#### Updated Files:

- `README.md`: Complete project documentation with setup instructions

## Key Features

### ✅ Two-Tab Interface

- **Tab 1 - Register Product**: Quick product registration
- **Tab 2 - Products List**: View products with QR codes

### ✅ Automatic QR Code Generation

- QR codes automatically generated from Product ID
- Displayed in list view and detail view
- Downloadable with custom filenames

### ✅ Assembly Instructions Management

- Add unlimited instructions per product
- Drag-and-drop ordering
- Optional illustration images
- Inline editing support

### ✅ User-Friendly Interface

- Drag handles for reordering
- Inline editing for quick changes
- Visual indicators (blue highlight) for products with instructions
- Clean, modern UI following Odoo best practices

### ✅ Proper Permissions

- Users can create, read, update, and delete products
- Users can create, read, update, and delete instructions
- Page is read/write only (no create/delete)

## How It Works

### Product Registration Flow

1. User opens **Product Module > Product Assemble**
2. Goes to **Register Product** tab
3. Clicks "Add a line" or types directly in the table
4. Enters: Product Name, Product ID, and optionally Variant
5. Product is saved, QR code auto-generated

### Instruction Management Flow

1. User goes to **Products List** tab
2. Clicks on a product row
3. Product detail form opens
4. Navigates to **Assembly Instructions** tab
5. Adds instructions with drag-and-drop ordering
6. Saves and returns to list

### QR Code Generation

- Triggered automatically when Product ID changes
- Uses Python `qrcode` library
- Generates PNG image with appropriate size
- Encoded as base64 for storage
- Downloadable with filename: `qr_{product_id}.png`

## Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies

- **Odoo 18.0**: Base framework
- **Python qrcode**: QR code generation
- **PostgreSQL**: Data persistence
- **Docker**: Containerization

### Code Quality

- Clean, well-documented code
- Proper error handling
- Following Odoo development best practices
- No linter errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Product Registration**: Test creating products with various IDs
2. **QR Code Generation**: Verify QR codes are generated correctly
3. **Instruction Management**: Test adding, editing, deleting, and reordering
4. **Permissions**: Verify users can perform all expected operations
5. **Photo Upload**: Test uploading product photos and instruction illustrations
6. **Drag & Drop**: Test reordering of both products and instructions

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Potential future improvements:

- Add product categories
- Export QR codes in bulk
- Print assembly instruction sheets
- Add video support for instructions
- Multi-language instruction support
- Product version tracking
- Integration with MQTT for IoT devices

## Migration Notes

If you have existing data:

1. Backup your database before updating
2. Upgrade the module in Odoo
3. Existing products and instructions should migrate automatically
4. QR codes will regenerate on first access

## Support

For issues or questions:

- Check the module README: `odoo/addons/product_module/README.md`
- Review Odoo logs: `docker-compose logs -f odoo`
- Verify permissions in Security menu
